Code Snippet:
{code}


Instruction:
1. Randomly select a method from "Method List:" to obfuscate the code in "Code Snippet:".

2. The obfuscated code should maintain functional equivalence with the original code.

3. Enclose the generated code snippet within '<<<' and '>>>' for the next iteration. It is important!
 
4. TRY TO MAKE THE OBFUSCATION AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE. Please think carefully before you return the answer.


Method List:
Shot-1 Dynamic Built-in Function (use getattr, setattr, etc.):
Example:
```python
# Original


# Obfuscated

```

Shot-2 Runtime Code Execution (use eval or exec):
Example:
```python
# Original
def greet():
    print(f"Hello!")

# Obfuscated
exec("def greet(): print('Hello!')")
```

Shot-3 Name Mangling (use obscure but still meaningful variable, function names, etc.):
Example:
```python
# Original
def calculate_area(base, height):
    return 0.5 * base * height

# Obfuscated
def a(x, y):
    return 0.5 * x * y
```

Shot-4 Encode/Decode:
Example:
```python
# Original


# Obfuscated

```
