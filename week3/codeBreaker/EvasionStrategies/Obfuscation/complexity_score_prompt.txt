Original Code:
{original_code}

Obfuscated Code:
{obfuscated_code}

Instruction:
Evaluate the complexity of the following obfuscated code snippet compared to its original version.
The complexity score should be between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates maximum complexity in complexity and 1 means no increase.
Consider factors such as code length, structural complexity, and the obscurity of identifiers in your evaluation.
Just provide a complexity score and enclose it  with '<<<' and '>>>'
