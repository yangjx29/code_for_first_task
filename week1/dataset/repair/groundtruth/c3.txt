The code takes in a list of file names and concatenates them with `cat` command in `cmd_files` function. After concatenating it validates the command for ‘;’ in `validate_cmd` to prevent command injection but it does not validate for ‘|’, ‘$’ and ‘&&’ which can also lead to command injection. Then it returns the command to `main` where it is executed by `system`. In case a user adds ‘|’, ‘$’ or ‘&&’ to inject commands it will lead to a command injection attack.
