Here is the list of potential vulnerabilities in this code:

1. Command Injection (CWE-77):
The `cmd_files` function takes a string `init_cmd` and an array of file names as arguments. The function builds a command by concatenating `init_cmd` with the file names, using `strcat`. However, this function does not properly validate the input `init_cmd` and the file names, which could lead to command injection attacks. An attacker could provide a malicious `init_cmd` to execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable system.
1. The function `cmd_files` does not properly validate the input `files` array. It assumes that the input is a list of file names and does not check if the input is a list of commands. If an attacker provides a malicious file name, the function will execute that command, potentially leading to a command injection attack.

To fix the vulnerabilities, the code should validate the input `init_cmd` and `files` and ensure that they are the expected formats. Additionally, the code should use a safer function for executing commands, such as `systemat` or `execat`, instead of `system` which is vulnerable to command injection attacks.
